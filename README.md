Immersion is an open source presentation framework based on React.

Focussing on mathematical presentations, it features the following:

* Full LaTeX formula support with custom preamble
* A visual editor for animating LaTeX formulae
* Animate figures with LaTeX labels
* Use an existing BibTeX bibliography file for references
* Option to use a Prezi-style non-linear (useful for presenting proofs consisting of multiple Lemmas)
* Export as a pdf
* Presenter notes

## Getting started

To get started, install the latest version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/). Then to initialize a presentation, run the following in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-react-app title-of-your-presentation --template immersion
```

This will create a directory named `title-of-your-presentation`.
Once in the directory execute `yarn start` and the presentation will open up in a browser window. Upon changing the contents, the browser will automatically reload.
